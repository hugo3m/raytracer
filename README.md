# Raytracer

Raytracer built in Rust web assembly served with NextJS, inspired from [Computer Graphics from Scratch, Gabriel Gambetta](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/index.html).

**Yes**, I am aware that the built folder should not be pushed to the repository. But it made things easier to deploy on Vercel ðŸ™‚

## Folders

* `app`: NextJS app folder
* `components`: NextJS components
* `utils`: Utils for NextJS, such as singleton engine.
* `src`: Rust files
